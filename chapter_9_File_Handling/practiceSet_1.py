# os Module Methods --> You can use the os module to perform operations like checking if a file exists, removing a file, or renaming it.

# (a) Check if a file exists

# if os.path.exists("chapter_9_File_Handling/writeFile.txt") :
#     print("File exists.")
# else :
#     print("File does not exist.")


# (b) Remove a file
# os.remove("chapter_9_File_Handling/writeFile.txt")

# (c) Rename a file 
# os.rename('chapter_9_File_Handling/writeFile.txt', 'chapter_9_File_Handling/newWriteFile.txt')

# (d) Get file size
# file_size = os.path.getsize('chapter_9_File_Handling/newWriteFile.txt')  # Returns file size in bytes
# print(f"File size: {file_size} bytes")

# If you want to add content to an existing file without overwriting its data, use the append mode 'a'.
# with open('chapter_9_File_Handling/newWriteFile.txt', 'a') as file:
#     file.write("\nThis is an appended line.")


with open('chapter_9_File_Handling/poem.txt', 'r') as text :
    lines = text.read()
    if "twinkle" in lines:
        print("The word 'twinkles' is found in the poem.")
    else :
        print("The word 'twinkles' is not found in the poem.") 

# f.close()
